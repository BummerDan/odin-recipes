    <h4 class="title">Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 oz GOYA Jumbo Squid in Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Lester Fixins' Mustard Flavored Soda Pop</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Pacifico Beer 24oz Can</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Gatorade lime cucumber flavor</li>
        <li>Splash of mustard soda</li>
        <li>splash of Gatorade lime cucumber flavor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="title">Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First, take a sip of Lester Fixins Soda and make sure it really tastes like Mustard. Once you know it’s not bullshit, move onto the next step below:</li>
        <li>Pour the entire GOYA Jumbo Squid into a cobra-themed pint glass. Some extra room is required for the other ingredients, so use a fork to eat some of the squid and oils from the glass. Stop eating when roughly a quarter of the glass is filled./li>
        <li>Next, pour in the Lester Fixins soda. Then, pour in the Lime Cucumber Gatorade. It’s not finished yet, but start drinking some anyway. Next, pour in the Pacifico Beer. Finally, add a splash of Lester Fixins AND a splash of Lime Cucumber Gatorade to top it off.</li>
        <li>Before you start chugging away at this gnarly-looking drink combo, let it stoop and get all funky in the glass. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
